Quarter 2 Project Proposal:
- **What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**<br>
    The most interesting topic covered so far is the utilization of graph database to replace relational database for storing lab data.

- **Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**<br>
    Assuming that graph is a naturally good way to represent the lab's data. Whether we can further use the characteristic of graph data and build a graph machine learning model

- **What is a potential change youâ€™d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**<br>
    push back automation part, and focus on fetching existing data to build machine learning model

- **What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**<br>
    Cloud storage instead of local NAS
